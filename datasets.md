In this page, we present all of our publicly available datasets.

**Octopus Database**

This dataset contains data about commits, refactorings, code smells and source code metrics from 50 Java open source projects. The dataset is stored in a Neo4j database. 
The dataset (including usage instructions) is available at [figshare](https://figshare.com/s/3ac0da284f700d186dfa).
