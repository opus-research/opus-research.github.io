**Organic 2.0**

Organic 2.0 is an Eclipse plugin that aims to collect code smells and agglomerations from Java projects using only command line tools. The main objective of this project is to collect data with no user interaction. It does not provide user interface and this is not what we planned for this plugin. This plugin is directed to people who wants to run experiments by analyzing the existence of code smells and agglomerations in several projects.

**Organic 1.0 (Ancient)**

Organic 1.0, which we nicknamed as Ancient Organic, was designed to help programmers in identifying design problems in the source code of Java projects using code smell agglomerations. For detecting code smells, Organic 1.0 rely on the smell detection engine from the [JSpIRIT tool](https://github.com/hcvazquez/JSpIRIT), which also use agglomerations for prioritizing code smells.
