## Abstract

Code refactoring aims to improve code structures  via  code  transformations. Up to 60% of the code refactorings in software projects are constituted of refactoring sequences. However, the knowledge about the application of refactoring sequences is scarce and the existing automated support tools for refactoring sequences is limited. An investigation in depth about refactoring sequences is necessary because developers apply refactoring sequences manually while they perform other code changes frequently. That can increase the development effort and degrade the software quality because developers have limited knowledge about how to combine refactoring sequences and their effect for each development activity. Based on those limitations, this project aims to (i) characterize refactoring sequences; (ii) understand how developers apply refactoring sequences; (iii) investigate techniques for identification of existing refactoring sequences in software projects, (iv) 
evaluate the effect of refactoring sequences on software quality, and (v) investigate techniques for the recommendation of refactoring sequences.
