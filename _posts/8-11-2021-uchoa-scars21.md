Our paper entitled **Do Critical Components Smell Bad? An Empirical Study with Component-based Software Product Lines** was accepted at the 15th Brazilian Symposium on Software Components, Architectures, and Reuse (**SBCARS'21**). The study was led by our PhD student, Anderson Uch√¥aa, and had the collaboration of professors and researchers from PUC-Rio.
