        The OPUS Research Group was founded in 2009 by Professor Alessandro Garcia on his arrival to the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro - Brazil. Several master and doctoral students and renowned international researchers belong to this community. We are working together within the field of software composition in order to:

        - provide the means to empirically analyze the positive and negative effects of individual modularization mechanisms and techniques on key software quality attributes, and
        - investigate new solutions for modularity that best fit the quality requirements of contemporary application domains.
        
        The OPUS Research group is also particularly interested in advanced techniques for modular programming, automated support for code smell detection, and methods for building software product lines..

        Enjoy your visit!
